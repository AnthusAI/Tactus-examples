# Useful Agent Patterns

This directory contains a series of examples demonstrating common and advanced patterns for building AI agents with Tactus.

## Series Goals

1.  **Showcase Patterns**: Demonstrate reusable architectural patterns (RAG, Sub-agents, HITL, etc.).
2.  **Prove Simplicity**: Show how Tactus reduces the code required for these patterns compared to Python/TS.
3.  **Real-World Context**: Each example is grounded in a realistic use case.

## Agent Instructions

**READ `../EDITORIAL.md` FIRST.**

When working in this directory:
*   **Structure**: Follow the "Structure of an Example" in `EDITORIAL.md`.
*   **Comparison**: Explicitly look for opportunities to highlight Tactus's conciseness.
*   **Testing**: Ensure every example has a corresponding `.spec` file that runs in the CI environment (using mocks).
